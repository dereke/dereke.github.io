[![The gnome wallpaper selector in action](/images/posts/gnome-3-wallpaper-extension.png "Gnome wallpaper selector")](/images/posts/gnome-3-wallpaper-extension.png)

[Javier Goday](http://jgoday.wordpress.com/) has [just released](http://jgoday.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/gnome-shell-extension-wallpaper/)
a great new extension for Gnome 3.0. While many people don’t like Gnome 3.0 and think it is a step backwards, extensions like this are just one of the things that make it a really interesting proposition.

The extension allows you to very quickly change wallpapers sourced from either files stored on your computer or the vast collection of [deviantart](http://www.deviantart.com/).
Javier has augmented the overview with a “Wallpaper” tab which allows you to navigate andselect the image you desire.

You can get the extension from [here](https://github.com/jgoday/gnome-shell-extension-wallpapers).
